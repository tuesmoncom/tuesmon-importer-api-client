== Authentication

The first step to use the Tuesmon client is to create an instace to connect to the server and authenticate a user in Tuesmon.


[source, groovy]
----
import net.kaleidos.tuesmon.TuesmonClient

TuesmonClient client = new TuesmonClient('http://tuesmon-server-url.com')
client.authenticate('username' 'password')
----

After the sucessful authentication you can use the client to connect to the Tuesmon Import API.
